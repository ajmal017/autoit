# MyTradeWizard.exe

Interactive Brokers provides a wonderful API for trading stocks, options, futures and more.  Unfortunately, their Trader Workstation requires a restart every 24 hours.  This may be suitable for manual trading, but it poses a problem for those who wish to fully automate their trading systems.

MyTradeWizard.exe solves this problem, by restarting TWS and entering your credentials at a configurable time of day.  It was developed using the free AutoIt macro scripting language for Windows.  Even if you don't have an account with Interactive Brokers, you can run this application in demo mode.  Feel free to check out the .au3 script, or just download the .exe
